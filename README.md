# DEPRECATED: This project has been moved and generalized to [lerna-docker](https://github.com/rubensworks/lerna-docker).

# Comunica Lerna Docker

A simple tool for easily building and publishing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images inside Comunica [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) monorepos.

Features:
* Building Docker images for all packages that have a Dockerfile.
* Pushing Docker images to Docker hub based.
* Automatic Docker hub authentication for running in CI environments.

**Note: this tool is built for Comunica monorepos and will not work properly for other monorepos. We may generalize this tool to any lerna project in the future.**

## Requirements

* [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) _(Installed by default on UNIX machines)_
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [A Lerna project](https://lernajs.io/)

## Install

### Automatically

This will automatically clone this repo into `$HOME/.comunica-lerna-docker` (_requires [git](https://git-scm.com/)_),
and adds this tool to your `$PATH`.

```bash
$ sh -c "`curl -fsSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/comunica/comunica-lerna-docker/master/install.sh`"
```

If you want to uninstall later, just remove `$HOME/.comunica-lerna-docker` and the `$PATH` modification in `~/.bash_profile`.

### Manually

First, clone this repo somewhere:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:comunica/comunica-lerna-docker.git
```

Then, add the `/bin` folder to your `$PATH`.
For example, by adding the following to your `~/.bash_profile`

```bash
export PATH="/path/to/comunica-lerna-docker/bin:$PATH"
```

## Usage

All actions allow a custom version tag to be passed.
If no version is given, then either a version based on `$TRAVIS_TAG` or `"DEV"` will be assigned.

### Building

Build all Dockerfiles that can be found in `packages/*`:

```bash
$ comunica-lerna-docker build [version-tag]
```

### Pushing

Pushing all images to Docker hub based on the Dockerfiles that can be found in `packages/*`:

```bash
$ comunica-lerna-docker push [version-tag]
```

If you want to push in a CI environment,
you will have to log in to a Docker Hub account,
which can be done by setting the (secret) environment variables `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`.
